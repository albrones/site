    <h2>Professional Profile</h2>
    <p>“I’m a tech passionate and want to thrive my skills in information technology and agile management in projects that positively shape our lives and world. My motto: building effective systems requires smart user experience and lean impacts”</p>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Passionate by tech and curious by nature, I love discovering and perfecting new skills. Immersed in ecology from my early age, I'm now keen to pass on these values to the IT world through eco- design and responsible digital as much as possible, reducing its impact and making it easier to implement (GreenIT, ShadowIT, Agility). After several experiences in France, my ambition is to move to Northern Europe to widen my experience and expertise, through new challenges and cultural contexts. I believe that we need to prepare and develop our organizations considering the environmental challenges of our society.</p>
